console.log("I love Javascript");

// A value is basically a smallest unit of inforamtion we have in javascript (example)
let age = 10; //let is a datatype and age is the variable and 10 is the value (It is a declared statement)

// A variable would not start with a number / symbol it cause a unexpected syntax error  ( _   and   $ ) sign are only allowed
_name = "nanda";
$name = "gopal";
// let 3name = "nanda";  This will cause an error and the error will be displayed in console inside the browser
//should not start a variable with uppercase letter instead use the camel case (firstName)

let PI = 3.14;   //convention
console.log(PI);

//correct camel case approach    It is more descriptive variable assigning approach
let myCurrentJob = "Programmer";
let myOldJob = "Software";

//non descriptive approach
let job1 = "teacher";
let job2 = "student";

let _function = "reception"
let $function = "reception"

//A variable should not be used as a reserved javascript keyword example
// let new = "name";   here new is a reserve js keyword (It shows a unexpected tocken error)

//Another one reserved keyword and illegal to use example
let name = "banda"; //name is reserved keyword inseted we can use firstName / lastName in javascript

//A Variable which is all in Uppercase are reserved for constants
