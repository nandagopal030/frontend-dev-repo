// A value is basically a smallest unit of inforamtion we have in javascript (example)
let age = 10; //let is a datatype and age is the variable and 10 is the value (It is a declared statement)

// A variable would not start with a number / symbol it cause a unexpected syntax error  ( _   and   $ ) sign are only allowed
_name = "nanda";
$name = "gopal";
// let 3name = "nanda";  This will cause an error and the error will be displayed in console inside the browser
//should not start a variable with uppercase letter instead use the camel case (firstName)

let PI = 3.14;   //convention
console.log(PI);

//correct camel case approach    It is more descriptive variable assigning approach
let myCurrentJob = "Programmer";
let myOldJob = "Software";

//non descriptive approach
let job1 = "teacher";
let job2 = "student";

let _function = "reception"
let $function = "reception"

//A variable should not be used as a reserved javascript keyword example
// let new = "name";   here new is a reserve js keyword (It shows a unexpected tocken error)

//Another one reserved keyword and illegal to use example
let name = "banda"; //name is reserved keyword inseted we can use firstName / lastName in javascript

//A Variable which is all in Uppercase are reserved for constants
console.log(name);
console.log(_function);
console.log(myOldJob);

//boolean value
true;
console.log(true);

//typeof
let jobApplication = "Amazon";
console.log(typeof true);
console.log(typeof jobApplication);

//changing the value with the same variable

let year;
console.log(typeof year); //this gives an output as an undefined

year = 1919;
console.log(typeof year); //this gives an output as an number

console.log(typeof null); //this gives an output as object


// let const var
// keyword ->  It is a reserved word like if for while new
// datatype -> It defines the kind of value a variable holds
// we use let  to redeclare at any point of our code

//let                  (block level scope)
let age = 30;
age = 31;     //This is called mutation where while we use let the variabel can be changed(mutable)
console.log(age);

// const
//Always make sure to use const if there is no change to be made in the further code for the paritcular variable assignment
const birthYear = 1919;  // where const is immutable if it is declared once it cannot be redeclared
// birthYear = 1920 causes a Typeerror in the console

//var (which was not nessasary to use to assign a variable it has the same functionality that let has )example
var job = 'coder';          //(Functional level scope)
job = 'high level designer';
console.log(job);  // no errror will be thrown

//javascript will not throws any error but still its a bad practice to write a code like this what javascript actuall do while we assign something is it will create a property in the global

//Type converison and coercion
// Type conversion is we are manually converting type from one type to another by adding the certain type and type coercion is javascript will automatically convert it.
