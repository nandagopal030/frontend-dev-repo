// A value is basically a smallest unit of inforamtion we have in javascript (example)
let age = 10; //let is a datatype and age is the variable and 10 is the value

// A variable would not start with a number / symbol it cause a unexpected syntax error  ( _   and   $ ) sign are oly allowed
_name = "nanda";
$name = "gopal";
// let 3name = "nanda";  This will cause an error and the error will be displayed in console
//should not start a variable with uppercase letter

let PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI);

//correct camel case approach
let myCurrentJob = "Programmer";
let myOldJob = "Software";

//non descriptive approach
let job1 = "teacher";
let job2 = "student";
